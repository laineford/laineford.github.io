      <p>She was like the weather outside, at first welcoming and warm, but the more you stood in front of her the more violent and cold she became. You tried to grab onto her, but her whirlwind of angry passion slipped through your fingers like a swirling blizzard. Her words were beautiful spider webs weaved on a beautiful March morning, but her intentions were sharp icicles carved one difficult January night, pointed directly at you, waiting for you to step under them so they could fall. Much like the weather, she was approachable until she wasn&#39;t. Always there, but temperamental and unpredictable. One day you could bask in the quiet serenity of her sunshine, and the next you could be the snarled branches of a tree twisted by her sudden hurricane. You sit and wonder. Behind all of that constantly moving energy, just a few moments for breaks where you- a sailor on an ever tumultuous sea- could breathe, there was something going on. She embodied the weather, the perfect bright and clean moments, and the blustery and stormy moments as well. But just as a the lion follows the prey, her mystery and intrigue pulled you into her path of destruction. Sure she was dangerous, but once you were there, you could truly understand the majestic and deeply hidden wonders of the eye of her hurricane.
