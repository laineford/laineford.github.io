      <p>She was like the weather outside, at first welcoming and warm, but the more you stood in front of her the more violent and cold she became. You tried to grab onto her, but her whirlwind of angry passion slipped through your fingers like a swirling blizzard. Her words were beautiful spider webs weaved on a beautiful March morning, but her intentions were sharp icicles carved one difficult January night, pointed directly at you, waiting for you to step under them so they could fall. Much like the weather, she was approachable until she wasn&#39;t. Always there, but temperamental and unpredictable. One day you could bask in the quiet serenity of her sunshine, and the next you could be the snarled branches of a tree twisted by her sudden hurricane. You sit and wonder. Behind all of that constantly moving energy, just a few moments for breaks where you- a sailor on an ever tumultuous sea- could breathe, there was something going on. She embodied the weather, the perfect bright and clean moments, and the blustery and stormy moments as well. But just as a the lion follows the prey, her mystery and intrigue pulled you into her path of destruction. Sure she was dangerous, but once you were there, you could truly understand the majestic and deeply hidden wonders of the eye of her hurricane.

      <p>Some of the sweetest torture in the world is love. The idea of the person is just enough to send you over the clouds around the moon and back. The thought propels you forward, just a few more seconds, minutes, hours, days until they respond. Until you can see them and basque in the glory of their presence and their being. They chose you. Their love is a pool. Open only to some, but bathing in it&#39;s warm waters soon becomes addictive. You sit in the pool letting the water carry and support you, unphased by any small ripples that may come across your path. You have to watch yourself,  though. There are some unpredictable storms, and all of a sudden, the pool that you once floated in without a care in the world can become a deluge. The calm waters transformed into a torrent. The peaceful serenity you used to experience in its wake morphed into a vicious cascade of water that is escapable, but not without sustaining heavy damage. You still relish the thought of soaking in the water. Letting it wash over you. Keeping the comfort that the water used to give you. But the water has grown far beyond your control. Despite your most tenacious attempts to keep yourself afloat and prospering in the water, it begins to drown you. You know it&#39;s best to get out now, before the water swallows you whole, but something about the way you used to feel draws you deeper into the overflowing tide. However, you realize although the water wants to keep you close, you no longer feel safe. Those feelings have faded and it&#39;s time to leave. The waters will find another victim. But your time is up. This pool no longer feels like home. The water will miss you deeply, your being in its essence. But you will be stronger, more secure even, without it. &quot;Nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love.&quot; Move on. It&#39;s time.
