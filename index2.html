      <p>She was like the weather outside, at first welcoming and warm, but the more you stood in front of her the more violent and cold she became. You tried to grab onto her, but her whirlwind of angry passion slipped through your fingers like a swirling blizzard. Her words were beautiful spider webs weaved on a beautiful March morning, but her intentions were sharp icicles carved one difficult January night, pointed directly at you, waiting for you to step under them so they could fall. Much like the weather, she was approachable until she wasn&#39;t. Always there, but temperamental and unpredictable. One day you could bask in the quiet serenity of her sunshine, and the next you could be the snarled branches of a tree twisted by her sudden hurricane. You sit and wonder. Behind all of that constantly moving energy, just a few moments for breaks where you- a sailor on an ever tumultuous sea- could breathe, there was something going on. She embodied the weather, the perfect bright and clean moments, and the blustery and stormy moments as well. But just as a the lion follows the prey, her mystery and intrigue pulled you into her path of destruction. Sure she was dangerous, but once you were there, you could truly understand the majestic and deeply hidden wonders of the eye of her hurricane.

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p> Recently, my mother made a push for me to start reading more books. When I was younger, I used to devour tales and novels. But as I continued into middle and high school, I stopped reading for fun. If I did read, it was for school and not for pleasure. With that, my mother wisely suggested that I pick up a book and read it because I wanted to do so. I chose Eat, Pray, Love. 

I began reading this book at a busy point in my life, so it was hard for me to get through it, simply because I was fairly strapped for time. Yet, every chance I could get to read this book, I did. The more I read, the more the story captivated me. In the book, the author, Elizabeth Gilbert, travels to three countries: Italy, India, and Indonesia, in order to learn more about herself and how to thrive. Throughout the book, Gilbert details aspects of her life that changed through her experiences in these three countries. This book began to resonate with me. Gilbert describes how, prior to her trip, she believed that she was wasting time if she was ever resting or relaxing. In order for her to feel fulfilled, she had to be doing something at all times. Given that I was reading this part of the book at a time in my life when I was also pushing myself to do everything that I could, I began to connect to Gilbert in a way that pulled me further into her story and challenged me to look at my life differently. 

For the duration of her book, Gilbert pushes herself to relax and take time for herself, whether that entails being mindful and meditating or eating all of the best food that she can find. She forces herself to pursue joy in lieu of busywork disguised as fulfillment. As she changed in her book, it gave me an opportunity to change myself as well. I have always been worried that if I’m not working on a project or competing to do my best academically and athletically, I’m wasting my time and not doing all that I can. But Gilbert’s story inspired me to change the way that I view life and myself. I began to do yoga, to help myself slow down and to give me time for myself. I started to cut down on some of the time that I was spending on all of my activities, to help myself relax. I used to have a “life maximization” journal in which I wrote my daily accomplishments so I could review them in a year and properly assess if I had succeeded in life. I falsely equivocated my accomplishments with self-fulfillment.  Now, after reading Eat, Pray, Love, I make an effort to seek joy. I was able to connect with this story and as a result, I have altered the way that I approach life. Stories have the wonderful ability to force connections between characters and the reader, forcing the reader to be introspective. Without stories, this world would be dull, and void of crucial empathy and human connection. We would loose a wealth of valuable opinions and lessons, and history would make its best attempt to repeat itself. Stories have the most amazing capabilities to bring us togerher, and inspire the best in people. The capability to push us to take risks, reach out to others and change our behavior. Nothing in this world can do that the way that stories can. It is unique only to them. 

But just think about it. Many of the things that we hold dearly in this world are stories: The news, our conversations, our TVs, our books, family traditions, songs, theater, and some could even argue sports. These things, all rooted in story telling. Stories bring us together as families and as people. We need stories to keep us together. To give us valuable empathetic connections. And to help us change.
