      <p> Recently, my mother made a push for me to start reading more books. When I was younger, I used to devour tales and novels. But as I continued into middle and high school, I stopped reading for fun. If I did read, it was for school and not for pleasure. With that, my mother wisely suggested that I pick up a book and read it because I wanted to do so. I chose Eat, Pray, Love. 

I began reading this book at a busy point in my life, so it was hard for me to get through it, simply because I was fairly strapped for time. Yet, every chance I could get to read this book, I did. The more I read, the more the story captivated me. In the book, the author, Elizabeth Gilbert, travels to three countries: Italy, India, and Indonesia, in order to learn more about herself and how to thrive. Throughout the book, Gilbert details aspects of her life that changed through her experiences in these three countries. This book began to resonate with me. Gilbert describes how, prior to her trip, she believed that she was wasting time if she was ever resting or relaxing. In order for her to feel fulfilled, she had to be doing something at all times. Given that I was reading this part of the book at a time in my life when I was also pushing myself to do everything that I could, I began to connect to Gilbert in a way that pulled me further into her story and challenged me to look at my life differently. 

For the duration of her book, Gilbert pushes herself to relax and take time for herself, whether that entails being mindful and meditating or eating all of the best food that she can find. She forces herself to pursue joy in lieu of busywork disguised as fulfillment. As she changed in her book, it gave me an opportunity to change myself as well. I have always been worried that if I’m not working on a project or competing to do my best academically and athletically, I’m wasting my time and not doing all that I can. But Gilbert’s story inspired me to change the way that I view life and myself. I began to do yoga, to help myself slow down and to give me time for myself. I started to cut down on some of the time that I was spending on all of my activities, to help myself relax. I used to have a “life maximization” journal in which I wrote my daily accomplishments so I could review them in a year and properly assess if I had succeeded in life. I falsely equivocated my accomplishments with self-fulfillment.  Now, after reading Eat, Pray, Love, I make an effort to seek joy. I was able to connect with this story and as a result, I have altered the way that I approach life. Stories have the wonderful ability to force connections between characters and the reader, forcing the reader to be introspective. Without stories, this world would be dull, and void of crucial empathy and human connection. We would loose a wealth of valuable opinions and lessons, and history would make its best attempt to repeat itself. Stories have the most amazing capabilities to bring us togerher, and inspire the best in people. The capability to push us to take risks, reach out to others and change our behavior. Nothing in this world can do that the way that stories can. It is unique only to them. 

But just think about it. Many of the things that we hold dearly in this world are stories: The news, our conversations, our TVs, our books, family traditions, songs, theater, and some could even argue sports. These things, all rooted in story telling. Stories bring us together as families and as people. We need stories to keep us together. To give us valuable empathetic connections. And to help us change.

      <p> Once I was young: a girl blossoming with ideas. A girl blissfully unaware with only the best in mind. A girl whose rose colored glasses would be removed with age. Walking through halls of a school excited for the coming day. A pen with endless ink and a mind with infinite flow: the bounds of imagination unknown. But the well ran dry. The pen ran out. Eventually a fountain of worthy concepts slowed to a dribble. What once was an oasis of thought became a desert of analysis, void of personality. And I am left here with a mind just the shell of what it once was.

	Once I was young: a girl so unapologetically herself. A girl so confident in who she was. Unafraid of her surroundings. Clueless about standards.  Unencumbered by the thoughts of others. Free from the criticism of the world. But slowly she felt the gaze of society. Judging curves, figure: an unforgiving vision of beauty. Once a temple for celebration, her body became graveyard for confidence and strength. Her waist was met with the cold plastic of a measuring tape. Always a set of eyes, staring, watching. Her own eyes monitor the ratio of her hips. And I am left here with the remnants of an overworked and tired body.

	Once I was young: a girl with strong will. A girl who knew who she was. A girl that listened only to herself. Carefree and strong. Knowing her self worth and accepting nothing less for herself. Dependent on parents and no one else. But her dependence grew. Dependence on boys. Dependence on the opinions of strangers she had no intention of ever talking to. Dependence on being perceived. The strong pillar of self worth was chipped away. A string of boys became the map of her journey through self doubt and loathing. And I am left with the pieces of a girl who forgot who she was. 

	Now I’m a woman: putting together the puzzle of my imagination. Turning my slow dribble into a trickling stream. Teaching myself to reach into the depths of my dreams to pull out worthy stories. Recognizing that even with evil in the world, prosperity and hope can be found with the right mindset. Remembering the way that the words used to flow like wine, and if not achieving it quite yet, beginning a new passage for my experiences. 

	Now I’m a woman: resting a beautiful body. Working out not to shrink but to grow. Learning that numbers don’t mean anything when not in the context of math. Finding strength in my form whatever it may be. Accepting that I am responsible for myself, and society can say absolutely nothing. I am fulfilled only by my own standards. Remembering the days in which a body was a mere vessel for new adventures, and working my way back.

	Now I’m a woman: sticking myself back together. Understanding that as long as I’m happy, I can be happy. Knowing that others opinions only carry the weight that I give them. Learning that I am worth everything in the world and I deserve nothing less. Not half. Not a quarter. The entire world. Remembering a time that I ran across the playground without an inkling of public opinion, blithe and beautiful.
